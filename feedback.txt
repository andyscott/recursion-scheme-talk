- smooth off the slide/explanation transition from cata to hylo

- address: why should we bother using recursion schemes?
  note-- the talk goal isn't to answer this, it's just to explain the
  basics in a fun way. However, some context would be good.

- maybe focus more on examples such as pretty printing

- add examples of directly calling unwrap/step functions on some data

- :thumbsup: for teasers and pointers to other material for further learning
  about specific areas/topics (like fix/cofree/free, or the more "advanced"
  schems)
